PTRE — Label Definition (Phase 4)
What the labels represent

In PTRE, labels represent the future directional trend, not price prediction.

They answer the question:

Given today’s market structure, what was the risk-adjusted directional outcome over the next 10 trading days?

The labels are defined using two formulas working together.

Formula 1 — Future Return (Direction)

Future 10-day return:

r(t,10) = ( P(t+10) − P(t) ) / P(t)

Where:

P(t) = price at time t

P(t+10) = price 10 trading days in the future

This formula answers:

Did the price actually move up or down over the next 10 trading days?

This captures direction, but not whether the move was meaningful.

Formula 2 — Risk Normalization (Context)

Risk-adjusted return:

z(t) = r(t,10) / σ(t)

Where:

σ(t) = vol_10d at time t (historical volatility)

This formula answers:

Was that move significant relative to risk, or just noise?

Risk normalization ensures:

High-volatility stocks are not over-rewarded

Low-volatility stocks are not unfairly penalized

Trends are comparable across stocks and regimes

Final Label Logic

Labels are assigned using symmetric thresholds on the risk-adjusted return.

Condition → Label → Meaning

z(t) ≥ +0.75 → +1 (Bullish)
Strong upside trend relative to risk

z(t) ≤ −0.75 → −1 (Bearish)
Strong downside trend relative to risk

otherwise → 0 (Neutral)
Noise, chop, or insignificant movement

What the labels are (important)

Labels are future-looking

Labels encode direction + confidence

Labels are volatility-aware

Labels are classification targets

In short:

Labels = future trend classification

What the labels are NOT

The model is not learning:

“Predict the price”

“Predict the exact % return”

Those problems are unstable and unrealistic in financial markets.

What the model actually learns

The model learns:

“Given today’s features (market structure), what is the probability of each future trend state:
Bullish, Neutral, or Bearish?”

This makes PTRE:

More robust

More interpretable

Defensible in real-world use

Suitable for risk-aware decision making

One-line mental model

Features describe today’s market structure.
Labels describe tomorrow’s risk-adjusted trend.
